## Micado Interview UI

Displays the number of active and recovered covid patients based on the date range in real time.

## Requirements

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

## Setup

- Run `yarn`
- Run `yarn start`


Note that I am aware of some minor UI bugs regarding the text overlap in the graph, and the last date in the react datepicker is always selected.
